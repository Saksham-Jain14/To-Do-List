# To do List

Description: An easy-to-use to-do list tool that lets you mark and unmark things to indicate whether they have been finished or not Various categories can be used to view tasks.

Problem Statement: Create a simple Todo list with vanilla JS (as you see in the GIF below). Vanilla JS means no plugins, no libraries, nothing.

Required Features:

- A minimal design with HTML and CSS, it should look nice (no libraries, no frameworks).
- A text box at the top to add a todo item to the list.
- Add button: when a user clicks on the button, add that todo item to the list.
- A delete button to delete the todo item completely from the list.
- A checkbox to check the item off the list. (checked item should stay in the list, with some differentiation from rest of the todo items).
- Total number of tasks in the list.
- Extra points for creativity (think about user accessibility, some animations and things like that).
